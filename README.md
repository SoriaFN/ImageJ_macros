# ImageJ Macros
A collection of random ImageJ/FIJI macros I use at the lab for analysis of fluorescence images.

## How to use
1. Click on the ImageJ/FIJI script (".ijm" file) you want to download.
2. Click on "Raw"
3. Save page as .ijm file
4. Drag and drop the ijm file onto FIJI (or install macro in ImageJ)

## Macros currently listed (as of Feb 2021)

- **DoG Filter**  A simple Difference-of-gaussians filter for fluorescence images.
- **Draw_Trajectory** Draws a trajectory of a single molecule on top of its video file based on coordinates previously calculated in TrackMate.
- **MIP_timelapse**  A script to generate registered Maximal Intensity Projections from tridimensional time-lapse images (hyperstack with xyzt).
- **Microglia_Morphology**  A script to calculate Form factor, Density and Fractal Dimension from binary images of individual cells.
- **Microglia_pixels_surveyed**  A script to calculate instantaneous and cumulative area surveyed by microglia in two-photon time-lapse images.
- **Autosegment_and_coloc**  A script to segment and calculate colocalization in multichannel images.
