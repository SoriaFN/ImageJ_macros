# ImageJ Macros
A collection of random ImageJ/FIJI macros I use at the lab for analysis of fluorescence images.

## Macros currently listed (as of Sep 2020)

- **DoG Filter**  A simple Difference-of-gaussians filter for fluorescence images.
- **Draw_Trajectory** Draws a trajectory of a single molecule on top of its video file based on coordinates previously calculated in TrackMate.
- **Microglia_Morphology**  A script to calculate Form factor, Density and Fractal Dimension from binary images of individual cells.
- **AutoSeg_Coloc**  A script to segment and calculate colocalization in multichannel images.
